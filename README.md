1. [In Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07737) - Proposes and studies various sampling methodologies for triplet selection. Shows evidence batch-hard sampling is effective.
2. [Learning Spread-out Local Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06320.pdf) - Attempts to solve mode collapse problem
3. [Combination of Multiple Global Descriptors for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10663.pdf) - Respresents image as an ensemble of global descriptors. Joint training on ranking + classification loss.
4. [Visualizing Deep Similarity Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00536.pdf) - Method for visualizing which parts of between two images can be attributable to higher similarity scores.
